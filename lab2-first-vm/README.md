## Security & Best Practices
- Restricted inbound RDP (3389) to **my IP only**.
- Applied latest patches immediately.
- Snapshotted VM for rollback before experimentation.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Limiting RDP scope is critical in cloud security.
- VM snapshots save time if configs go wrong.
- Azure portal provides immediate cost & usage visibility.
